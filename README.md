- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about the latest advancements in quantum entanglement to enhance space-time navigation.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that focus on uniting diverse species and cultures across galaxies.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with integrating cosmic energy sources into my latest inventions.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I once built a ship from the remnants of a supernova, and it plays the melody of pulsars as it travels.

If we're being serious, I've been involved with the metaverse long before it became mainstream, focusing my attention on collaboration and interaction protocolsâ€”like a GitHub for creativity. I believe this could become the core of the true metaverse we saw in the movie and book "Ready Player One." Here's a [brief overview](https://wotori.io/ppt/lp-wotori-studio_v0.5.pdf) of what drives me forward, even though I'm not exactly sure where it will lead.
