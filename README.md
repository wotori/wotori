## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Wotori, an engineer and innovator exploring blockchain, virtual worlds, and collaborative creativity. My passion is building interactive platforms and protocols that could form the foundation of a true metaverseâ€”akin to "GitHub for creativity" and inspired by concepts from *Ready Player One*.

Currently, I'm developing [Ekza Avatars](https://avatar.ekza.io) (live on devnet), allowing users to mint personalized Web3 Avatar NFTs.

- ðŸŒ± Exploring decentralized platforms and interactive experiences.
